# Product Launch Page

This is a simple product launch page built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase for managing subscriptions. The page features a countdown timer, product highlights, and testimonials, as well as a popup that allows users to subscribe for updates and categorize themselves based on their reason for subscribing.

- **Categorization of Subscribers:** Based on the user input in the popup, subscribers are categorized into different segments like `student`, `teacher`, `partner`, or `general`.
